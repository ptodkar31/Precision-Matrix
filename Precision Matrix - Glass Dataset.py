Problem statement-
A glass manufacturing plant uses different earth elements to design 
new glass materials based on customer requirements. For that, they would 
like to automate the process of classification as itâ€™s a tedious job to manually 
classify them. Help the company achieve its objective by correctly classifying 
the glass type based on the other features using KNN algorithm.
